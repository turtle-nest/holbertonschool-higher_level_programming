# Python - Import & Modules

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It covers the basics of importing modules in Python and using functions and variables defined in other files. You will learn how to organize your code into reusable modules and import these modules into your scripts.

## Content

- Importing modules and functions
- Using variables defined in other files
- Organizing code into reusable modules
- Conditional execution of code with `if __name__ == "__main__"`

## Files

- `0-add.py`: Imports the `add` function from the `add_0.py` file and prints the result of the addition.
- `1-calculation.py`: Imports functions from the `calculator_1.py` file and prints the results of calculations.
- `2-args.py`: Prints the number of arguments and the list of arguments passed to the script.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: Prints the result of the addition of all arguments passed to the script.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: Prints the names defined in the compiled `hidden_4.pyc` module.

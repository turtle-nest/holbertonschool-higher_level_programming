# Python - If/Else, Loops, Functions

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It covers the basics of control structures in Python, including if/else statements, loops, and functions. You will learn how to use these structures to control the flow of your program and write functions to organize and reuse your code.

## Content

- Using if/else statements for decision making
- Creating and using for and while loops
- Defining and calling functions
- Manipulating strings and numbers
- Using Python's standard modules and libraries

# Python - Higher Level Programming

## Python - Hello, World

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It covers the basics of Python programming, including running Python scripts, printing text, and working with strings and numbers.

### Files

- `0-run`: Script that runs a Python script.
- `1-run_inline`: Script that runs Python code from an environment variable.
- `2-print.py`: Prints a specific string.
- `3-print_number.py`: Prints a number followed by a string.
- `4-print_float.py`: Prints a float with 2 decimal places.
- `5-print_string.py`: Prints a string three times, then its first 9 characters.
- `6-concat.py`: Concatenates two strings.
- `7-edges.py`: Extracts specific parts of a string.
- `8-concat_edges.py`: Concatenates parts of a string to form a new string.
- `9-easter_egg.py`: Prints the Zen of Python.
- `10-check_cycle.c`: Checks if a singly linked list has a cycle.
- `lists.h`: Header file for linked lists.

## Python - If/Else, Loops, Functions

This project covers the basics of control structures in Python, including if/else statements, loops, and functions. You will learn how to use these structures to control the flow of your program and write functions to organize and reuse your code.

### Files

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: Prints the last digit of a number.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, except 'q' and 'e'.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: Prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: Prints numbers from 0 to 99.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: Prints all possible combinations of two digits.
- `7-islower.py`: Checks if a character is lowercase.
- `8-uppercase.py`: Converts a string to uppercase.
- `9-print_last_digit.py`: Prints the last digit of a number.
- `10-add.py`: Adds two numbers.
- `11-pow.py`: Computes the power of a number.
- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: Prints numbers from 1 to 100 with substitutions for multiples of 3 and 5.
- `13-insert_number.c`: Inserts a number into a sorted linked list.
- `lists.h`: Header file for linked lists.

## Python - Import & Modules

This project covers the basics of importing modules in Python and using functions and variables defined in other files. You will learn how to organize your code into reusable modules and import these modules into your scripts.

### Files

- `0-add.py`: Imports the `add` function from the `add_0.py` file and prints the result of the addition.
- `1-calculation.py`: Imports functions from the `calculator_1.py` file and prints the results of calculations.
- `2-args.py`: Prints the number of arguments and the list of arguments passed to the script.
- `3-infinite_add.py`: Prints the result of the addition of all arguments passed to the script.
- `4-hidden_discovery.py`: Prints the names defined in the compiled `hidden_4.pyc` module.
- `5-variable_load.py`: Imports the variable `a` from the `variable_load_5.py` file and prints its value.
